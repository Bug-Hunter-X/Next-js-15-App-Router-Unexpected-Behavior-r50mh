# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using a simple function component in the `pages` directory.  The expected behavior is a simple 'Hello World' rendering. However, in some cases (potentially related to specific configurations or other dependencies), the application may fail to render correctly, resulting in an unexpected display or error. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the rendered output.  It might render correctly, or it might fail to render 'Hello World' as expected. The issue is intermittent and difficult to pinpoint.

## Potential Causes

While the root cause is unknown, potential factors contributing to this intermittent issue could be:
* Specific version of Next.js or related dependencies.
* Conflicting configuration in `next.config.js`.
* Server-side rendering issues.

## Solution

The solution may involve carefully reviewing the Next.js documentation, ensuring that the project setup aligns perfectly with best practices and debugging potential server-side rendering problems.
